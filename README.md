## Overview

This project is a **recipe page** that presents a simple omelette recipe with preparation time, ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and nutritional information.  
It focuses on typography, spacing, and semantic HTML.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Custom fonts** (`Outfit`, `Young Serif`)
- **Responsive design** with media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### Key features

- Clear recipe layout with headings and sections
- Preparation time block with styled markers
- Ingredients and instructions with **styled lists**
- Nutrition section using a **table** with borders
- Fully responsive (desktop and mobile)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **typography hierarchy** and **list styling** with custom markers.

Example: Custom marker styling for ordered lists:

```css
.fifth ol > li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility with ARIA roles.

- Add interactive elements (e.g., “Copy ingredients” button).

- Explore using CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- MDN CSS documentation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
